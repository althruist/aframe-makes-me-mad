# EnvVR - VR Game Project for Project Class</h1>
**EnvVR** is a small <sub>yet complicated to make</sub> VR game as a project for.. you guessed it.. project class!

This game allows you to view a basic concept of 2 worlds (the forest and the ocean) adapting to climate change and how we can help!

The entire project is based on [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) (with a touch of native Three.JS and other components), and all the files are neatly organised for your convenience.

**Head over to [my page](https://althruist.fyi) to play the game!!**
